    <h1>About Me</h1>
</div>

<p style="padding: 10px"> Born and raised in a small town in the western side of Puerto Rico, I would always spend my time learning about society, philosophy, mathematics, and technology. This passion grew thanks to the example of great professors that helped me connect ideas between these fields, especially between mathematics and computer science.</p>

<p style="padding: 10px">As a professional, I work developing software and solving data analysis problems, but in my in my spare time I enjoy spending time with family, exploring the outdoors, having philosophical conversations with my friends, playing sports, and reading. </p> 

<p style="padding: 10px">During my final professional years, I would like to become a college professor to help other students grow in passion for computers and mathematics just as my professors helped me. I believe a positive impact on the younger generations can also impact the world.</p>
